Removed on author request because it was causing problems talking to publishers.

I think it's a reasonable request to make public scrapers unavailable for this reason, and have done so. If you've written a scaper, I would appreciate it if you took the time to read the discussion and use your own judgement as to whether to take it down.

If wildbow's site goes down with no print version, and I cannot contact them for a few months, I will post an ebook version in place of this scraper.
